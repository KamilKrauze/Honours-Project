# Honours Project: Image Enhancement of Aniographic Images using Contrasting Techniques

> The project currently uses Python for quick and easy iteration and implementation however, for faster execution of heavier algorithms this project will migrate to `C++`.

This is a WIP project for my honours assignment. The goal is experiment and used various image enhancing techniques and alogrithms to easily segment and isolate coronary artery.
